# draft-quantum-connection-setup

This draft describes the architecture of connection setup in a network. Path creation is triggered by an application at the Initiator, information is accumulated node-by-node on an outbound pass in a series of QCap (quantum capability) blocks, then the RuleSets are created at the Responder. Details of the RuleSets and QCaps, addressing architecture, link protocols, routing, resource allocation (multiplexing), extension of this setup procedure to an internetwork, and extension to multiparty communications are beyond the scope of this draft.

This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the provisions of [BCP78](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp78) and [BCP79](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp79).
